## Make vectors
"c()"

```{r}
marmots <- c("blue", "green", 4, "yellow")

#check class of objects: "character"...to determine how you analyze data.
class(marmots)
```

```{r}
pika <- c(12.4, 6.8, 2.9, 8.8, 8.5)
class(pika)

#Scalar multiplier

5.2 * pika #this will run & show answer in console, NOT stored in environment.You'd have to store it to some name...
scalar_pika <- 5.2 * pika
scalar_pika #to have it show the vector on your knitted document
```

```{r}
#matching lengths (shown in environment)...  can add/subtract/etc the two vectors
bananas <- c(1, 2, 3)
apples <- c(6, 7, 8)

bananas + apples
bananas - apples

#dot product (%*%)
bananas %*% apples
#if vectors were orthogonal/perpendicular, dot product would be zero.

```
